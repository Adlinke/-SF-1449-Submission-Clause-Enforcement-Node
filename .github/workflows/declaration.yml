  statement:
    - I was forced into transitional housing since 2007 without lawful alternative.
    - I have been continuously exposed to violence against women, children, and myself.
    - Attacks have not been stopped for even one minute; authorities failed to enforce protection.
    - The dynamic of aggression is systemic, constructed, and unforgivable.
    - Climate and housing challenges were used as justification, but they do not excuse unlawful exposure.
  enforcement:
